I am a postdoc fellow in Research Application Laboratory at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I currently work with [Dr. Andrew Newman](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/anewman) on the NSF [Navigating the New Arctic project](https://www.colorado.edu/research/arctic-rivers/) looking at climate change across the Arctic, specifically the Yukon River Basin across Alaska and Northwest Canada. I have a Ph.D. degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington. I am an alumni of [Computational Hydrology Group](http://uw-hydro.github.io/) and my doctoral advisor is [Dr. Bart Nijssen](https://www.ce.washington.edu/people/faculty/nijssenb). My doctoral dissertation focuses on investigating climate change impacts on hydrology and aquatic environment for large-scale river systems under anthropogenic influences. I am proficient in High Performance Computing (HPC) and some coding languages, e.g., Python and Fortran.
