I am a Ph.D. student in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington and a member of [Computational Hydrology Group](http://uw-hydro.github.io/). My advisor is [Dr. Bart Nijssen](https://www.ce.washington.edu/people/faculty/nijssenb). My doctoral dissertation focuses on investigating climate change impacts on hydrology and aquatic environment for large-scale river systems under anthropogenic influences. I am proficient in High Performance Computing (HPC) and some coding languages, e.g., Python and Fortran.
