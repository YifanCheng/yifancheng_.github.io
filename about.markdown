I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [UW Hydro \| Computational Hydrology Group](http://uw-hydro.github.io/) in the [Civil and Environmental Engineering Department](http://www.ce.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://uw.edu/).  My research focuses on developing and evaluating computational models to simulate complex, coupled land-atmosphere and land-ocean processes.  I have also been an active developer of a number of Python and C [software](/software) projects.
