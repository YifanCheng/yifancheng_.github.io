While I'm not really much of a blogger, I often find myself combing through old programs looking for a trick I discovered months ago.  I’m hoping this blog will serve as a log of cool things I come across as I’m working (see below for a short description of what I do).  For the most part, I’ll be focusing my effort on computing topics as they pertain to the science of hydrology.

#### Who am I? ####
I am a fourth year graduate student in the [Land Surface Hydrology group]( http://www.hydro.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington]( http://www.washington.edu/).  My research focuses on macro-scale hydrologic modeling, coupled land-atmosphere and land-ocean processes, and regional climate modeling.  As such, I spend most of my work time in front of the computer screen.  However, when I do manage to escape, you’ll find me in the mountains.
