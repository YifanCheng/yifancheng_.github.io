      "Like many in the geophysical sciences these days, my preferred data format is [netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) (Network Common Data Form).  netCDF offers \"a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.\"  The fact that the format is self-describing and machine-independent has allowed for the development generic processing tools.  Considerable work has gone into developing some very nice and quite advanced netCDF file operators.  The two libraries I find myself using on a daily basis are [NCO (netCDF Operators)](http://nco.sourceforge.net/) and [CDO (Climate Data Operators)](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Cdo#Documentation).\n",
      "\n",
      "Both NCO and CDO were developed for use on the command line or in the shell (e.g. bash).  While the shell is really nice for doing basic operations, I still don't find it convenient for more complicated file handling operations.  In walks Python.  Python has been my scripting language of choice and I have found that it offers some nice solutions for file handling.  A few years back, Ralf Mueller introduced a set of Python bindings to CDO.  `cdo.py` allows the user to call any of the CDO operators from within python.  As far as I know, no one has done this for NCO, so I gave it a go.  "

      "### NCOpy\n",
      "[NCOpy](https://github.com/jhamman/nco-bindings) is a clone of the [cdo-bindings](https://github.com/Try2Code/cdo-bindings) Python module.  It follows basically the same syntax as `cdo.py` with a few adjustments.  The biggest difference is in its handling of keyword arguments.  If you have used NCO before, you know that there are dozens of keyword arguments.  In `nco.py`, any long name (e.g. `--append`) command line argument can be passed to nco.py as a keyword argument (e.g. `append=True`). Here are some examples:\n",
