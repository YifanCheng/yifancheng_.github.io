#### Pangeo
[Pangeo](https://pangeo-data.github.io) is a community effort for big data in the geosciences. As part of this effort, we are bringing together the a collection of Python tools, including Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter to facilitate highly scalable data analytics on large geoscientific datasets.

#### Xarray

[Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org) (formerly `xray`) is the fusion of Python's Pandas, Numpy, and netCDF4 packages. It offers unparalleled computational ability on labeled N-dimensional arrays. I have been contributing to the Xarray project since May 2014.

#### VIC

From 2012-2016, I was part of the core development team working on the [Variable Infiltration Capacity](http://vic.readthedocs.org) macro-scale land surface hydrology model. During this time, I acted as the VIC model administrator, responsible for the [VIC github](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC) repository, making releases, and issuing bug fixes. I continue to contribute to VIC development.

#### RVIC

[RVIC](http://rvic.readthedocs.org) is a source-to-sink linear routing model used to route streamflows from runoff produced in macro-scale hydrologic models such as VIC. RVIC is written in Python and C and is publicly available [here](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/RVIC).

#### pynco

[pynco](http://pynco.readthedocs.org) is a set of Python bindings to the popular [netCDF Operators (NCO)](http://nco.sourceforge.net/).  This package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynco), [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pynco), and [Github](https://github.com/nco/pynco).
