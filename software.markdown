#### VIC

For the majority of my Ph.D., I have been one of the main developers of the [Variable Infiltration Capacity](http://vic.readthedocs.org) model. During this time, I have acted as the VIC model administrator, responsible for the [VIC github](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC) repository, making releases, and issuing bug fixes.

#### RVIC

[RVIC](http://rvic.readthedocs.org) is a source-to-sink linear routing model used to route streamflows from runoff produced in macro-scale hydrologic models such as VIC. RVIC is written in Python and C and is publicly available [here](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/RVIC).

#### pynco

[pynco](http://pynco.readthedocs.org) is a set of Python bindings to the popular [netCDF Operators (NCO)](http://nco.sourceforge.net/).  This package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynco), [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/ioos/nco), and [Github](https://github.com/nco/pynco).

#### xray

[xray](http://xray.readthedocs.org) is the fusion of Python's Pandas, Numpy, and netCDF4 packages. It offers unparalleled computational ability on labeled N-dimensional arrays. I have been contributing to the xray project since May 2014.
