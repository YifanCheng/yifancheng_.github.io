Just a quick note to announce a [new AGU session](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/preliminaryview.cgi/Session26340.html) that Charlie Zender, Ryan Abernathey, and myself are putting together.
We're hoping to see a nice collection of presentations covering cutting edge data analysis tool. Final deadline for submitting abstracts is August 2, 2017.

**Session ID#:** 26340

### Session Description:
Rapid analysis and interpretation of large model and measurement datasets is increasingly undertaken as a sequence of institution-supported pre-processing and user-devised post-processing (e.g., scripting of specialized statistics and visualization). By providing a pre-agreed format for data and metadata, the first stage ensures dataset utility and interoperability. In the second stage the user community employs diverse software practices and specialized toolkits to pursue their data analysis. Users now routinely attempt to ingest entire satellite records or MIP archives to complete their analysis. This often requires interactive and batch workflows to scale from the desktop to distributed-HPC systems. Such workflows must adjust to available memory constraints, provide access to CPU and cluster-level parallelism, while remaining flexible and easy to customize. How ought researchers utilize the unprecedented volume of data with metadata-aware analysis tools to answer tomorrow's data-intensive questions? This session will demonstrate state-of-the-art approaches to gigabyte- through petabyte-scale geoscientific data analysis.
