I started a postdoctoral fellow position at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/yifanc) in August 2020. My study will pivot from the Southeastern United States to a much colder region, i.e., Alaska and Yukon River Basin. I will work on an NSF-funded interdisciplinary project, Navigating the New Arctic ([NNA](https://www.colorado.edu/research/arctic-rivers/)). I will closely work with [Dr. Andrew Newman](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/anewman) on a high resolution WRF-CTSM coupling in RASM framework and parameter estimation for the state-of-the-science land surface model, Community Terrestrial Systems Model ([CTSM](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/)).
