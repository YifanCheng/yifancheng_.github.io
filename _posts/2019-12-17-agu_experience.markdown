In AGU 2019, I presented two posters, one for myself and one for my collaborator [F. R. Fonseca](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco_Ralston_Fonseca). For the past three years, we worked together in [an NSF-funded interdisciplinary study](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1441131), investigating climate change impacts on food-water-energy nexus in the Southeastern United States. My work focuses on water, and his work focuses on energy.

In this poster, I aimed to simply illustrate the impacts of climate change and human activities on the thermal regime in a regulated river system, and how that would affect the freshwater fish distribution in the Southeastern United States. We used a physically-based modeling framework to simulate river temperature in a complicated multi-reservoir system, and we have summarized this work in a paper, which is currently under revision in Water Resources Research.
