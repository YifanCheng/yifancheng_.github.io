I am currently seeking for a post-doctoral position after graduation (expected graduation date: May 2020). I have a broad interest in a variety of topics, e.g.,  physically-based or statistical hydrologic modeling, climate change impacts, anthropogenic impacts, aquatic ecosystem/biodiversity, and machine learning. 

During my doctoral studies, I have developed a competitive background in high-performance computing and physically-based modeling. If you are interested in recruiting a postdoc or believe I am a good fit for some position, please reach out to me via [yifanc6@uw.edu](mailto:yifanc6@uw.edu). I genuinely appreciate it.
